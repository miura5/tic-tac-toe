The program waits for a start command with any combination of options to set player one and player two
(for example, "start user user" will let both players accept input; "start medium hard" will set both players as AI)
Options:
    * user
    * easy
    * medium
    * hard

I created this project mainly to practice the following topics:
    * Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming
    * Manipulation of arrays
    * Recursion
    * Error handling
